# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started Sustain Market Project by setting up an Flask API for vendors connected to a MongoDB Atlas Cloud NoSQL Database. Added CRUD functionality to the API. I also setup the storyboards for Cocktail Maker iOS app. 

**Thoughts**: I struggled with working with ObjectId type and coming up with ideas for designing the API.
